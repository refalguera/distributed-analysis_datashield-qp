## OPAL and OBIBA
DataShield requires Opal to be installed - see:

OPAL: Opal is the OBiBaâ€™s core database application for epidemiological studies. It is used to build study's central data repositories that integrate under a uniform interface data collected from multiple sources (including Onyx). Using Opal, studies can import, validate, derive, query, report, analyse and export data.
